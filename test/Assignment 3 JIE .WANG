Exercise

You're working on a project to develop a login system for a website. The website requires the user to enter a username and password to log in. Write a Python program that checks whether the user entered the correct username and password.
Create two variables called username and password and set them to any valid string values.
Prompt the user to enter their username and password using the input() function.
Use conditionals and logical operators to check whether the username and password entered by the user match the username and password variables.
If they match, print “Login successful.” If they don't, print “Incorrect username or password.”

# Set sys id and pass
sys_id = 'admin'
sys_password = 'password'


# Prompt User
user_id = input('Please enter your username:  ')
user_password = input('Please enter your password:  ')
# Our initial check, while not equal we will enter loop
while sys_id != user_id and sys_password != user_password:
    # we have entered the loop , this means the username/password do not match 
    print("Incorrect username or password ")
    user_id = input('Please enter your username:  ')
    user_password = input('Please enter your password:  ')

print("Login Successful")
